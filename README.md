# dropdown-menu

A clean and simple dropdown-menu made as an assignment for The Odin Project "Dynamic User Interface" Module.

## Tasks

- You can allow the menu to show up either on click or on hover.
  - What I did is the menu will show up when the button is clicked.
- You should hard-code the menu items into your HTML but hide/reveal them using JavaScript. You can do this either by adding a class (visible or something) or by manually setting the style in JS.
  - Hardcoded the menu items in the HTML file and handle the revealing using the toggleDropdown function which adds and removes a "open" class to the element.
- Make sure the JavaScript code is reusable! You should be able to create multiple drop-downs on a page using HTML and reuse the JavaScript logic to hide/reveal them.
  - Made sure to make the code reusable. Allowed the user to copy the dropdown or add a menu item without having to worry about the functionality. The function already handles newly added dropdown or menu items.
